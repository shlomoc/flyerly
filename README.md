## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. If you are using Google AI models with Genkit, you will need to add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```
    You can obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the Genkit development server (for AI features):**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for auto-reloading on changes
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will typically start the Genkit server on port 4000 and the inspector on port 4001.

2.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    Open another terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js application, usually on `http://localhost:9002`.

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to see the application.
